			<!--<p>iStockCheck is a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django web app</a>, hosted on <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">Python Anywhere</a>.
				It works by polling the Apple web endpoint which drives the iPhone reservation page, checking for combinations of stores and models.</p>-->
